=====
Written by Cherry (ilovecherries@protonmail.com)

it's written using C++17 and Xlib, so i guess have a compiler and xorg on your
computer. it should probably be easy to port to other systems?

uses cmake i don't remember how i built it lol.
probably uhhhh

ok yeah

cmake --build build

works and chip8 gets put in there.

i don't have a file picker or whatever yet. just recompile with a filename lolll
it takes like 2 seconds anyway
